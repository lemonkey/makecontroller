With the introduction of 	ActionScript, it has also become a powerful development tool.  When paired with the Make Controller Kit, ActionScript 	developers have an excellent resource to easily create beautiful and complex visuals coupled with physical interaction. 		The Make Controller Kit can connect to Flash via <b>OSC</b> (Open Sound Control), a popular protocol used to communicate between 	otherwise disparate environments and devices.  The Make Controller Kit 		\subsection architecture Architecture	FLOSC (a combination of Flash and OSC) is a separate application that must be run simultaneously with your Flash application.	Because Flash can't connect to external devices by itself, FLOSC is a necessary intermediate step - 	it can connect to the Make Controller over the network, and then it formats communication with the board	into XML that can be fed in and out of Flash.		The basic setup is that you run FLOSC, make sure your Make Controller is powered up, then start your Flash application.		\section gettingStarted Getting Started	If you haven't already, check the getting started guide at http://www.makingthings.com/makecontrollerkit/guides/adobe_flash.htm.	This will walk through the tools you need to download and give a quick overview on how to set them up	to get up and running.  		This document serves as a reference for the ActionScript classes themselves - take a look around by clicking	on the <b>Classes</b> link above.	\section osc OSC	"Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, 	and other multimedia devices that is optimized for modern networking technology."  	OSC is based on the notion of \b messages, which are composed of an address, and the data to 	be sent to that address.  The address looks a lot like a URL that you might type into	your internet browser.  Each element in the address is like a directory, with other 	elements inside it, and each element is separated from the next by a slash (/).  Each OSC	message must also start with a slash.  	\par Example:	For instance, the OSC address	\code /make/controller/kit \endcode	reads, "start in the 'make' directory, go down to the 'controller' directory, and 	finally to the 'kit' directory.  	Any number of \b argument \b values can be sent to that address by including them in the message	after the address.  These values can be integers, floats, or strings.  	\par Example:	If we wanted to send the value 35.4 to the address above, we would create the message	\code /make/controller/kit 35.4 \endcode	with a space between the address and the data.		Additional data can be added, each separated by a space	\code /make/controller/kit 35.4 lawn 12 \endcode	\section osc_mck OSC & the Make Controller Kit	Many devices on the Make Controller Kit can be addressed via OSC.  In sending messages to them,	we need to know the OSC address, and the appropriate argument values to send.	The Make Controller Kit is orgranized, for OSC, into \b subsystems.  Each subsystem has one or more	\b devices, and each device has one or more \b properties.  To address a particular device, you'll	need to create an OSC message specifying the address in that format: 	\code /subsystem/device/property \endcode	Each of OSC modules above provide the details for each of the subsystems on the board, along with their	devices and properties.  A simple example is given below.	\par Example:	To create an OSC message to turn an LED on, first identify the appropriate \b subsystem.	In this case, the subsystem is called \b appled.\n\n	There are 4 LEDs, so we need to specify which one to control.	The LEDs are numbered 0 -3, so choosing the first LED means the \b device value is 0.\n\n	The \b property of the LED that turns it on and off is its 'state'.		Lastly, we must specify what the state should actually be, by including an \b argument value after the address.	To turn it on, this value should be 1.  0 would turn it off.\n	The complete OSC message looks like	\code /appled/0/state 1 \endcode		The reference for all the OSC modules on the Make Controller can be found at 	http://www.makingthings.com/makecontrollerkit/software/doc/html/group___o_s_c.html*/
