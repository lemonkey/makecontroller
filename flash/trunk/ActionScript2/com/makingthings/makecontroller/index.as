With the introduction of 	ActionScript, it has also become a powerful development tool.  When paired with the Make Controller Kit, ActionScript 	developers have an excellent resource to easily create beautiful and complex visuals coupled with physical interaction.		<p>The Make Controller Kit can connect to Flash via <b>OSC</b> (Open Sound Control), a popular protocol used to communicate between 	otherwise disparate environments and devices.  For more info, check the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/tutorials/osc">OSC tutorial</a> 	on makingthings.com. </p>		<p>The Make Controller library consists of just a few classes:		<ul>			<li><a href="McFlashConnect.html">McFlashConnect</a> - our connection to mchelper. This provides many of the methods for sending and receiving messages.</li>			<li><a href="OscMessage.html">OscMessage</a> - the kind of message that we'll be sending to and receiving from the Make Controller.</li>			<li><a href="Board.html">Board</a> - a representation of one of the Make Controller Kits connected to mchelper. </li>		</ul>	</p>		<h3>Getting Started</h3>	If you haven't already, check the MakingThings <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/tutorials/flash">getting started guide</a>.	This will walk through the tools you need to download and give a quick overview on how to set them up to get up and running.		<h3>Architecture</h3>	mchelper is a separate application that must be run simultaneously with your Flash application.	Because Flash can't connect to external devices by itself, mchelper is a necessary intermediate step - 	it can connect to the Make Controller over the network and USB, and then it formats communication with the board	into XML that can be fed in and out of Flash.	<h3>OSC</h3>	Open Sound Control (OSC) is the protocol the Make Controller uses to communicate with other devices and software environments.	For a description of how it works, check the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/tutorials/osc">OSC tutorial</a> on the MakingThings site.		The reference for all the OSC modules on the Make Controller can be found at 	http://www.makingthings.com/ref/firmware/html/group___o_s_c.html*/
