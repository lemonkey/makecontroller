Testing mchelper

Info
----------------------------------------------
This test suite uses the Qt QTestLib module to provide unit testing for mchelper.  Coverage is preliminary at the moment but we plan to expand.  See http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/qtestlib-manual.html for details on QTestLib.

Running
----------------------------------------------
To run the tests, use the runtests.sh script - this creates a test app and runs it.  Right now the script is geared towards use on OS X, but any additions are welcome.

When you're done, you can run cleanup.sh to clear out all the temp files created in the testing process
