\b mcbuilder 
\b0 is a simple IDE (integrated development environment) for the Make Controller that makes it easy to:\
 * create new programs for the Make Controller\
 * upload & run your new programs\
 * communicate with the Make Controller via USB once it's up and running\
\

\b\fs28 Install
\b0\fs24 \
To install, simply drag the mcbuilder directory to your 
\b Applications
\b0  directory (or anywhere else you'd like to keep it).  \
\
If you're running OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or later and have not already run the OSXUploader.mpkg installer, do this before connecting your Make Controller.  This is a one-time installation to solve a USB issue on OS X that prevents uploading new firmware.  You may have already run this if you installed mchelper, but it doesn't do any harm to install again.  \
