If it's not already here, you need to grab the firmware code for the Make Controller.  

You can use any version you like, but the latest is always at https://www.makingthings.com/svn/firmware/trunk.  The 'cores' and 'libraries' directories from the firmware codebase should be placed here, such that the structure from the root of the mcbuilder directory looks like:

mcbuilder
  / cores
    / makecontroller
      / core
      / libraries
