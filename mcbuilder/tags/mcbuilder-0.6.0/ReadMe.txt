mcbuilder 0.6.0

* Notes
mcbuilder is written with Qt - you'll need at least Qt 4.4.0 installed in order to build it.  Other than that, there are no special dependencies beyond gcc or another suitable C++ compiler.  Once you have Qt installed and added to your path, cd into the root mcbuilder directory and type 'qmake' and then 'make' in order to build it.

You'll also need to grab the latest stable firmware source from the MakingThings SVN repo , which for the moment is at https://www.makingthings.com/svn/firmware/tags/firmware-v1.5.1
