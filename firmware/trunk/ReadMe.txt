Make Controller Kit - Firmware

For a reference of the available modules, see http://www.makingthings.com/ref/firmware/html

Required Tools
===============
* a GnuARM toolchain - you can find pre-built versions at
** Windows: http://sourceforge.net/projects/yagarto/files/
** OS X and Linux: http://github.com/jsnyder/arm-eabi-toolchain/downloads
* the `make` utility - on OS X, you'll need to install the Xcode developer tools, on Windows YAGARTO provides it

Building
=========
* Navigate to a project directory, start with 'blink' since it's the simplest.
* type `make`
* a 'build' folder should be created with blink.bin in it - you can now upload this to your board
