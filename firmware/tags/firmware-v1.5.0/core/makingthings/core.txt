 \mainpage Make Controller Kit - Firmware API
 
 \section overview Overview
  
  The Make Controller firmware API provides a simple software interface to the Make Controller.  The main features
  include an \b OS (operating system), a full \b Ethernet system, a \b USB (virtual serial port) system, and many others.
  
  The \ref Core module provides the basic capabilities of the Controller and a variety of \ref Libraries provide
  additional functionality that can easily be added/removed based on the needs of a particular project.

  To jump right into browsing the entire API, click on \b Modules above.  For general info, check the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/documentation/tutorial/programming-the-make-controller-kit">
  Programming the Make Controller</a> tutorial on the MakingThings site.
  
  \section Tools
  The easiest way to get started programming the Make Controller is with \b mcbuilder, a program that provides 
  a simple development environment, compiler and uploader in a single download.  Check the 
  <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings download page</a> for details.
  
  Otherwise, programs for the Make Controller Kit can be built using the freely available ARM-flavored 
  version of the GCC compiler, \b arm-elf-gcc.  Many toolchains are available - OS X and Windows versions can 
  be found on the <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings download page</a>.
	Other good options include:
	- GNU-ARM: http://www.gnuarm.com
	- WinARM (Windows-only): http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/arm_projects/#winarm
	- YAGARTO (Windows-only): http://www.yagarto.de

	To upload new firmware to your Make Controller, you have a few options:
	- Use \b mcbuilder (Make Controller Builder) or \b mchelper (Make Controller Helper), from <a href="http://www.makingthings.com/resources/downloads">MakingThings</a>.
	- Use \b sam7utils, a command line app: http://oss.tekno.us/sam7utils
	- Use a JTAG device.

	Rowley also provides a very good IDE for ARM7 projects called \b CrossWorks, which supports in-circuit debugging.  There are single user
	licenses available.  Check http://www.rowley.co.uk/arm/index.htm
		
	\section Licenses
	The Make Controller Kit software environment is a fusion of four main bodies of code:
	- User code - the applications that you, the user, create.
	- MakingThings library - code that MakingThings has contributed to make it easier to work with the Make Controller Kit.
	- FreeRTOS - an open source Real Time Operating System for the SAM7X.  See http://www.freertos.org
	- lwIP - a complete and open source TCIP/IP code library.  See http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/

	This software is all open source, and thus subject to the licensing of each module 
	of code.  All MakingThings specific code is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, which is quite flexible for
	both open source and commercial projects.  Be sure to acquaint yourself with the licenses for the main 
	bodies of code in the Make Controller firmware codebase:
	- MakingThings: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html
	- FreeRTOS: http://www.freertos.org/a00114.html
	- lwIP: http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5

	\section Community
	As you begin to create projects with the Make Controller, please consider contributing any potentially helpful material you generate
	or come across.  This could be anything from source code, to schematics, to instructions on how to interface with a particular device.  Particularly good for sharing are additional libraries that provide further functionality.

	The best places to get in touch are:
	- MakingThings forums: http://www.makingthings.com/forum
	- MakingThings bug tracker & development wiki: http://dev.makingthings.com
	- MakingThings IRC channel: \b makingthings on \b irc.freenode.net

	We look forward to hearing about your projects!
