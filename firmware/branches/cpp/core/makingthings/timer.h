/**
  Provides a timer in a millisecond timeframe.
  
  A Timer is a convenient way to schedule recurring events.  

  \section typicalusage Typical Usage
  A timer can be set up to call a function of yours at a regular interval.  Below is a simple
  example that will increment a counter and take some action when it gets above a certain amount.  

  \code
  // first, we'll create a function that will get called by the timer.
  void myHandler( int id );
  int count = 0; // our current count
  void myHandler( int id )
  {
    count++;
    if(count > 500 )
    {
      // then do something here
      count = 0; // and reset the count
    }
  }
  
  // now create the timer
  Timer t; // don't need to specify a channel - defaults to 0
  t.setHandler( myHandler, 34 ); // register our handler with this timer.
  t.start( 250 ); // call our handler every 250 milliseconds
  \endcode
  
  \section notes Notes
  A few things to be aware of when using Timers:
  - In your handler, you must not sleep or make any RTOS-related calls.  Your handler should be as quick as possible
  so that other handlers don't get delayed.
  - To modify an existing Timer, stop() it and then start() it again.  Modifying it while running is not recommended.
  - There are 3 identical hardware timers on the Make Controller.  The first Timer that you create
  will specify which of them to use, and it will be used for all subsequent timers created.  
  If you don't specify a channel, 0 is used which is usually fine.  
  
  For higher resolution timing, check the \ref FastTimer
