/**
  \defgroup io Input / Output
  
  The Make Controller has a variety of options for controlling input and output.  This will
  depend on the board you're using - the Controller Board has the basics on it, and typically
  either the Application Board or Interface Board will provide some additional options.
  
  \section appboard Application Board
  The Application Board adds a few more elements not available on the Controller Board.  The 
  \ref dipswitch (App Board v1.x only) provides a simple 8-channel switch for manual configuration,
  and the AppLed class represents the 4 LEDs on the Application Board.
  
  Also specific to the Application Board, the \ref digitalin and \ref digitalout systems make it easy to 
  control the 8 digital ins and outs on it.  These are based on the \ref Pins system, but take care of
  some configuration for you.
